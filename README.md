# 🌐 Hamed Khodami — Personal Website

Hi there! 👋  
This is the source code for my personal portfolio website — a fully custom-built web app powered by Django and styled with Tailwind CSS.

It showcases my core skills in backend development and DevOps, through a clean, responsive interface for presenting my projects, skills, and resume.

The current version focuses on a minimal yet professional MVP, without authentication or real-time chat — keeping the system lightweight and goal-oriented. These features are planned for future iterations depending on project growth.
