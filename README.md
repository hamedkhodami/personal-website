# 🌐 Hamed Khodami — Personal Website

Hi there! 👋  
This is the source code for my personal portfolio website — a fully custom-built web app powered by Django and styled with Tailwind CSS.

It highlights my core skills in backend development, featuring:
- user authentication,  
- a real-time chat module,  
- and a clean, responsive portfolio interface.

Deployed on a Linux-based VPS using Docker, Gunicorn, and Nginx, this project reflects both my coding and DevOps abilities.
